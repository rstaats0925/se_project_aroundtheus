# Project 3: Around The U.S.

## Project Description

This project is a webpage that uses responsive design to adpapt to varying screen sizes from 320px to 1280px. Going from biggest to smallest screensize the amount of columns start at 3 then reduce down to 2 at around 930px. As the screen compresses the profile will rearrange itself to a vertical orientation instead of a horizontal one. For the mobile screensize the cards will be in a single column.

## Technologies Used

This page was made using just HTML & CSS by utilizing Flexbox & grid to position the elements, media queries to make the page more responsive, & font-face to style the text.
